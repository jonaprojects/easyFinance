# Instructions for representing data:

1.  Pick a new term and write a short & concise explanation on it in hebrew. You can use Google Bard, but you need to instruct it to write a VERY simple and a short explanation. Also look up some resources in hebrew, like websites (they're not supported yet though)
2.  Writing it in the txt file in the correct format 
3. Use processTerms.py in order to write/append it into the JSON file.
4. Then in the app we will read from the JSON file. We do not need to use LocalStorage or expo-sqlite to save the json file since it is read-only.

These features are still under development. You are welcome to contact me
